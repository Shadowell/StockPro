## Latest Completed Work

1. DataDev backend unblock
- Added missing `SchedulerService` DataDev methods (task CRUD, logs, run, scheduler reload).
- Added `data_dev_tasks` / `data_dev_logs` table init into local DB bootstrap.

2. Route/navigation completeness
- Wired `StockScreener` route and sidebar entry.
- Added `/screener` into Playwright route coverage.

3. Data schema and usability fixes
- Unified `stock_fundamentals` schema with actual read/write usage.
- Added compatibility column migration (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`) for old local DBs.
- Fixed stock search to read `current_price` instead of non-existent `price`.
- Fixed Data Quality check to use `current_price`.
- Fixed THS freshness check to support `ths_hot_history`.
- Updated SQL workbench fundamentals template query.

4. Backfill task behavior alignment
- `batch-import/historical-data` now validates and honors `task_type` (`history|fundamentals|all`).
- Removed misleading `indicators` option from daily backfill UI (it was not supported in that endpoint flow).

5. E2E dual-mode support
- Added `MOCK_API` gated test strategy:
  - `app.spec.ts` runs in mocked mode only.
  - `real-backend.spec.ts` runs in real-backend mode only.
- Added npm scripts:
  - `test:e2e:mock`
  - `test:e2e:real`

6. Backend startup guardrail
- Added health script: `scripts/backend-health.sh`
- Checks:
  - required python dependencies
  - critical backend module `py_compile`
  - optional health endpoint ping (`--ping`)

7. Real-backend regression fix
- Fixed `/api/v1/admin/task-status` 500 by adding missing scheduler methods:
  - `SchedulerService.get_status()`
  - `SchedulerService.fetch_and_save_all_stocks_history()`
- Extended real-backend E2E to assert `admin/task-status` endpoint.

8. Backend test-mode startup toggle
- Added runtime feature flags:
  - `ENABLE_SCHEDULER`
  - `ENABLE_REALTIME_SYNC`
  - `ENABLE_STRATEGY_EXECUTION`
- Backend can now start in lightweight test mode to avoid startup noise and external sync interference during E2E.

9. Offline market-overview path for E2E
- Added runtime flag:
  - `ENABLE_EXTERNAL_MARKET_FETCH`
- In `MarketService.get_market_overview`, when this flag is `false`:
  - no fallback to external market API
  - return cache-only stocks/indices
- Also guarded external fetch in:
  - `MarketService._get_cached_all_stocks`
  - `MarketService.get_all_sectors`
  - `MarketService.get_stock_fundamentals` (returns `external_fetch_disabled` if local data missing)

10. Database endpoint status-code correctness
- Fixed `database` endpoint exception handling to preserve `HTTPException` status codes.
- `/database/query` non-SELECT validation now returns `400` correctly (instead of being converted to `500`).
- `/database/table/{table_name}` now preserves `404` when table is missing.

11. Batch import task usability fix
- Removed unsupported `indicators` task from `BatchImportPanel` (backend rejects it in `/batch-import/historical-data`).
- Kept MA import in its dedicated card flow to avoid task-type mismatch and user confusion.

12. Database manager export completion
- Implemented CSV export for:
  - selected table preview data
  - SQL query result data
- Added empty-result disable states and reused a safe cell-stringify path.

13. Real-backend E2E deepening
- Extended `real-backend.spec.ts` from smoke checks to functional assertions:
  - `market/overview` response structure
  - `database/query` success + non-SELECT rejection
  - `data-dev` task CRUD + run + logs flow
- Switched real-backend suite to serial mode for deterministic shared-db mutations.

14. Data Hub V1 one-time refactor (功能重构)
- Added unified backend capability set under `/data-hub/*`:
  - dataset registry and freshness
  - job orchestration (create/list/detail/rerun/cancel)
  - quality governance report run/query
  - feature service for screener/factors
- Added local DB tables:
  - `data_hub_jobs`
  - `data_hub_quality_reports`
- Marked legacy endpoints with deprecation hints:
  - `/batch-import/*`
  - `/data-dev/*`
  - `/database/*`

15. Legacy-to-hub compatibility bridge
- `batch-import/historical-data` now internally dispatches to Data Hub job orchestration (`import_daily_data`) while preserving old response shape.
- `data-dev/tasks/{id}/run` now dispatches into Data Hub orchestration (`run_data_dev_task`) and returns `job_key`.

16. Frontend information architecture refactor
- Reworked Data Center page into Data Hub workflow tabs:
  - 数据资产 (`DataHubDatasetPanel`)
  - 生产任务 (`DataHubJobsPanel`)
  - 质量治理 (`DataQualityPanel` via data-hub quality API)
  - 特征服务 (`DataHubFeaturePanel`)
  - 兼容入口（保留旧模块入口并给出迁移提示）
- Reworked sidebar navigation into product modules:
  - 数据中台 / Research Lab / Strategy Factory / Execution & Risk

17. Research-side data source migration
- Stock Screener now prefers `/data-hub/features/screener` and displays snapshot date.
- Factor Library overview/stats/ranking now prefer `/data-hub/features/factors` and display snapshot version/date.

- `npm run test:e2e` latest (pass, 2 passed + 7 skipped)

## Known Gaps

1. Global system python env may miss transitive deps; backend startup is currently reliable via `backend/venv`.
2. Data module is stable at schema/API level, but large-data performance and long-running job reliability still need prolonged real-run validation.
3. Real-backend suite now covers core data flows, but long-duration reliability under high data volume is still unverified.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Add deeper real-backend assertions for `market/overview`, `database/query`, and `data-dev` CRUD flows.
2. Use `scripts/backend-health.sh --ping` + `npm run test:e2e:real` in CI/预发 gate.
3. Add integration test for `stocks/search`, `data-dev/tasks`, and `batch-import/historical-data` with temp SQLite.
